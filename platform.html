                                    High density telemetry or time series data, composed of measurements taken over
                                    regular time intervals with high resolution timestamps from electric grid sensors,
                                    provides a unique set of challenges for traditional relational databases and even
                                    scalable NOSQL data stores like Apache Cassandra. One of the critical metrics is the
                                    number of sensor measurements or data points the database can read and write per
                                    second per compute resource. The top contemporary time series databases can write
                                    approximately 1M points per second per node. For perspective, two hundred PMUs, each
                                    with 40 streams of 120Hz high-precision timestamped measurements, generate nearly 1M
                                    points per second. Further, some utilities already have more than 5,000 PMUs, not
                                    counting other sensors. Even if existing databases could handle the raw throughput
                                    required by existing sensor deployments, they cannot satisfy queries over large time
                                    ranges efficiently let alone handle the analytical workloads particular to time
                                    series data. Thus, the heart of this universal sensor platform needed to be designed
                                    for at least this level of performance to ensure that the necessary capabilities -
                                    extremely high throughput, fast response times for queries across time scales from

                                    The platform can be decomposed into several functional areas. Moving from left to
                                    right in the diagram, it supports the ingestion of both streaming and historical
                                    data archives in a wide range of formats at scale via the ingest engine. Data is
                                    ingested into a database specifically designed for dense time series sensor data,
                                    the Berkeley Tree Database (BTrDB) whose development was funded by the ARPA-E Micro
                                    Synchrophasors for the Distribution System project. Further, the platform contains a
                                    distributed analytics and computational framework designed to operate across time
                                    series in parallel, executing significantly faster than real time to handle both
                                    real time and historical analyses and the training of machine learning and deep
                                    learning algorithms. The platform provides numerous APIs that provide not only a
                                    direct connection for web applications including a data explorer, dashboards, and
                                    Jupyter Notebooks for ad-hoc analytics but also to utility planning and operations
                                    software, allowing for the seamless integration of highly novel algorithms with the
                                    real world. The sections below will describe each component in detail.

                                <p>
                                    The platform’s ingest engine handles two general types of data ingest each with
                                    unique requirements. The first type is data continuously streaming from real or
                                    virtual sensors. For streaming data ingest, the platform supports a broad range of
                                    standards including the nearly ubiquitous IEEE C37.118 for phasor measurement units
                                    and also file-based data transfers. The following transport and message protocols
                                    will be supported in the near future for data ingestion: GEP, IEC 61850, Modbus,
                                    DNP3, GOOSE, and GSSE. The platform’s open-source and modular nature allows for
                                    third-party contributions, speeding support of new protocols. As the number of
                                    sensor data formats is large, the ingest engine’s ability to rapidly develop and
                                    test data import from a new format is key. Equally important are tight, continuous
                                    data quality assessments of the actual sensor measurements to identify immediately
                                    any potential errors, including those in the ingestors.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Large archives from historians and other legacy systems are the second type of data
                                    that must be ingested by the platform, often for retrospective data analyses or to
                                    pre-populate the platform before receiving new streaming data. These data files,
                                    often terabytes in size, arrive in archive formats such as COMTRADE, Open Historian
                                    version 1 (.d files) and version 2 (.d2 files), and comma separated value files
                                    (CSV). Along with these common formats are several vendor- or utility-specific
                                    formats like PDAT developed at Bonneville Power Authority (BPA). As these large
                                    archives often represent multiple years of data for an entire utility, ingest must
                                    occur significantly faster than real time. Even at 100x real time, a year of
                                    historical data still requires over 3.5 days to be ingested into a platform.

                                    All of these innovations have led to the creation of a time series database at the
                                    heart of the universal sensor platform that has state-of-the-art performance. Early
                                    benchmarks demonstrated a throughput of 53 million inserted values per second and
                                    119 million queried values per second on a small, four-node cluster. More recent
                                    testing has shown that the system can support over 100,000 simultaneous PMUs, each
                                    providing at least 20 streams of 60Hz data. Since these benchmarks were taken,
                                    numerous improvements have been made to the database and these numbers are
                                    considered a lower bound. Additionally, the database itself has been fully
                                    parallelized so that additional nodes can be added to handle extra sensors without
                                    any performance decrease.

                                    To meet the requirements described above, a novel data structure for time series
                                    data was created—a time-partitioning, copy-on-write version-annotated k-ary tree—and
                                    implemented by the Berkeley Tree Database (BTrDB). Sensor data is intrinsically
                                    temporal data queried based on time ranges. The use of a time-partitioning tree not
                                    only allows for the efficient location of specific points but also creates an
                                    implicit index to the data without additional storage space, increasing overall
                                    system throughput (Andersen 2016).

                                    The raw measurements and timestamps are stored in the leaves at the bottom of this
                                    tree. Each higher level of the tree summarizes the child nodes below it.These nodes
                                    store statistical aggregates that originally included the min, mean, max and count
                                    of the number of data points. As data changes, the relevant aggregates are all
                                    efficiently recomputed while in memory. As the tree itself represents time, querying
                                    higher levels of the tree is asking the database for aggregations (rollups in time
                                    series parlance) over larger and larger time intervals. Thus, sensor measurements
                                    over a year, a month, a week, a day, a second are available nearly instantaneously
                                    to any user or application.

                                    is no penalty for older versions of the data). A user can query the exact state of

                                    Lossless compression reduces the storage requirements and consequently the financial
                                    burden of high frequency sensor data while still preserving the full fidelity of the
                                    measurements for future use. While lossless time series compression is a
                                    well-developed field, many existing algorithms have not been applied to grid data.
                                    Compressing PMU data is a priority due to the associated data volume and the fact
                                    that the behavior of the underlying physical process follows well understood
                                    statistical distributions, offering high compressibility. Klump explores the
                                    performance of off-the-shelf algorithms on PMU data; however, these algorithms
                                    compress complete data sets after the data has been collected (as is done on
                                    images). Other proposed algorithms for PMU data compression, leverage the low
                                    dimensionality of PMU measurements to achieve high compression ratios but also
                                    require non-streaming data and are lossy. A universal sensor analytics platform must
                                    be able to compress streaming, floating-point data in a lossless fashion, rather
                                    than compressing the complete data set after it is recorded. A scheme with these
                                    attributes is described by Andersen in 2016 as part of the original BTrDB
                                    implementation. It achieves an average compression ratio of 2.9 for PMU sensor
                                    measurements. This algorithm has since been evolved using techniques from other
                                    fields to approach a lossless compression of up to 10 to 1.

                                    Moving computation to the data is one of the hallmarks of big data systems and
                                    processing time series data at scale is no different. Thus, analytics and machine
                                    learning must be core components or “first-class citizens” of the platform. This is
                                    one of the fundamental reasons why it is impossible to add or “bolt on” real time
                                    analytics, let alone machine learning capabilities, to legacy systems with
                                    non-scalable architectures. Further, processing real world sensor data at scale
                                    brings additional, unique challenges for analytics.

                                    The analysis of sensor data occurs in one of two modes: (1) real-time, processing
                                    the data as it arrives (synchronously) or (2) retrospective or historical,
                                    processing a fixed amount of the data after it has arrived into the system
                                    (asynchronously). Both require rapid processing of the data. However, real time (1)
                                    processing establishes an explicit time budget for each computation, much like
                                    rendering a three-dimensional scene in a movie or video game at 30 frames per
                                    second. For the movie or game to not stutter, each frame must be completed within
                                    1/30 of a second. A sensor analytics platform that offers real time processing must
                                    offer such processing to all streams. While processing a single stream in real time
                                    may seem trivial, handling a million streams in real time is not and requires orders
                                    of magnitude additional computational resources and bandwidth. Retrospective or
                                    asynchronous processes often require the analysis of a large volume of data
                                    significantly faster than real time.
                                </p>

                                    Many traditional engineering analytics for sensor data apply a function to each data
                                    point or window of data points in one or more time series. A simple example of this
                                    is the calculation of frequency from phase angle data. Frequency is computed from a
                                    single input time series as the derivative of the phase angle measurement. A more
                                    complex analytic example is reactive power, which is computed from four measurement
                                    time series: the voltage and current phasors each consisting of a magnitude and a
                                    phase angle. However, analysis often requires the application of not one but a
                                    sequence of such functions. For example, a cleaning algorithm may first remove
                                    anomalous measurements from a voltage magnitude stream and then the “cleaned”
                                    version is passed through a function to compute the fundamental power. A universal
                                    sensor analytics platform must apply and orchestrate these types of functions in the
                                    appropriate sequence to thousands of data streams simultaneously while handling
                                    out-of-order updates to the individual data streams all in real time or to large
                                    historical data sets.

                                    Distillers are the “user-facing” portion of DISTIL. At the heart of each distiller
                                    is a smaller kernel that contains two functions; (1) the precompute allows the user
                                    to specify the data needed for the (2) compute function that will operate on the
                                    data and return the computed values and associated time ranges. Each distiller can
                                    emit one or more new time series called “distillates” that are fed back into BTrDB.
                                    This computational model covers a tremendous number of potential algorithms and
                                    operations that can be performed on time series data.

                                    This architecture focuses on efficient and reliable calculation and storage of these
                                    “distillates” in advance of queries, rather than just-in-time materialization. The
                                    advantage is that many months or years of analytical results can be queried in
                                    milliseconds. Moreover, everything is versioned: the data, the distillers, and the
                                    intermediate streams. As a change occurs, the framework determines what needs to be
                                    recomputed to produce consistent results with precise provenance and schedules the
                                    processing required to propagate the change through associated streams. Figure 4
                                    shows numerous distillers cleaning and transforming voltage and current phasors and
                                    feeding the generated data streams into additional distillers to facilitate more
                                    complex analytics and calculations.
