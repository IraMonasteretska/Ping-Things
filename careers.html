                                        physical assaults to an aging workforce and, most notably, from the demands of
                                        the energy transition. To successfully decarbonize, we must merge legacy, analog
                                        generation, transmission, and distribution systems with a myriad of new digital
                                        technologies, including new, unpredictable modes of generation and a host of
                                        compensation devices like statcoms, to deliver electric power to entire new
                                        segments of the economy. Thus, the energy transition is fundamentally a digital
                                        transformation.

                                        We have built a powerful, scalable time series data management, application,
                                        analytics, and AI platform to help all participants in the energy space make the
                                        green transition successfully and cost effectively and we need exceptional
                                        talent to join our small team. When we say time series, we mean a streaming
                                        sequence of tuples each with a timestamp and a floating point value [timestamp,
                                        value]; the value arises from a sensor taking a measurement of a real world,
                                        physical process at some sample rate, often significantly greater than 1 Hz. We
                                        have won grants from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E, and the National Science
                                        Foundation. If you have ever wanted to join a startup whose management is
                                        primarily technical and was breakeven before their Series A, this is that

                                                Firstly, the work itself is incredibly fulfilling. It provides me with
                                                the opportunity to refine the skills I've honed over the past 20 years
                                                while also presenting new learning opportunities. The level of
                                                independence and flexibility I'm given to execute my work leads to a
                                                deep sense of satisfaction and confidence in my abilities.
                                                Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is the team I have the privilege
                                                to work with. They are a group of exceptionally smart individuals who
                                                also happen to be incredibly humble. Witnessing their collaboration and
                                                dedication is truly inspiring and adds immense value to the work
                                                environment.”

                                                meetings.
                                                For the work itself, I like the tech stack (Go + k8s and some python),
                                                it is quite pleasant
                                                to work with compared to a lot of other things I have dealt with (like
                                                Java and C++ stacks).

                                The goal of this process is to effectively determine whether you and PingThings are a
                                good fit without lengthy or burdensome time commitments. Unlike the typical job
                                interview, PingThings doesn’t treat this as an adversarial process or zero sum game
                                where we are simply trying to hire you for the bare minimum total compensation package
                                that you might accept. Instead, we are trying to build the transparency, trust, mutual
                                respect, and open communication that have made PingThings successful and optimize for
                                the creation of a long term, mutually beneficial and collaborative relationship.

                                Critically, we want to do this as efficiently as possible and want both sides to be
                                respectful of each other's time and attention. This is our "getting to know each other"
                                phase and we want the interview process to be reflective of our company as a whole. If
                                there is something that you like about the experience, tell us. If there is something
                                that you don't like, absolutely tell us about it. Similarly, how you interface with the
                                company will be noted. We almost always use calendar links to make scheduling easy. If
                                you miss an appointment without any notification without a strong justification, it is
                                almost always a disqualification. Also note that if you are just "window shopping" or
                                "seeing what's out there," please don't interview with us. We only seek candidates who
                                are genuinely excited and motivated by our mission and technology.

                                        The introductory call will last anywhere from 5 to 60+ minutes. This call will
                                        almost always be with an officer of the company. The CTO typically handles the
                                        first engineering call. PingThings CRO will handle the first sales or business
                                        development call and the CEO typically handles everything else, including data
                                        science, operations, and others The intent of this call is to get know each
                                        other. This means that we will ask a lot of questions not just about your
                                        experience and background but who you are, what drives you, and why. This is
                                        also your chance to ask questions about PingThings and learn more about what the
                                        opportunity looks like for you.
                                    </p>

                                        Please note that a short call is not necessarily bad and, if we are certain that
                                        we are not moving forward, we will let you know during the call. Also, depending
                                        on the position being filled, there may be a second introductory call with
                                        another member of the PingThings team.

                                        This is the heart of our interview process. Given that it is more time consuming
                                        for both parties, we try to limit the number of candidates invited for this part
                                        of the process. The goal here is not to pose impossible problems or abstract bs
                                        problems (a la white boarding in technical interviews) but to recreate a
                                        scenario that simulates actual work at PingThings in an authentic environment to
                                        understand how you interact with the team, how you solve problems, how you do
                                        that thing that you do, and, ultimately, how you think. The CI (or CTI if it is
                                        a collaborative technical interview) typically lasts 60-120 minutes and is
                                        always virtual and will always have you working alongside one or more PingThings
                                        employees. Note that some preparation work may be required of the candiate.
